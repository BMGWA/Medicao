	The presence of technical debt in an application may bring significant losses to the organizations that develop these applications. Being able to know and manage this technical debt is an efficient strategy to obtain greater control of debt in the application and to use it in your favor, benefiting from their short-term gains and maintaining the long-term losses in the bands of interest of the organization. In this paper, a measurement methodology using GQM (Goal Question Metric) and technical debt for a IT service hiring context of the Public Federal Administration of Brazil is proposed.
